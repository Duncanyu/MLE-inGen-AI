180 THE GREAT GATSBY

“Yes. You know what I think of you.”

“You're crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell.
I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”

“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that
afternoon?”

He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had
guessed right about those missing hours. I started to
turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed
my arm.

“{ told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the
door while we were getting ready to leave, and when
I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to force
his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I
hadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on
a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the
house—” He broke off defiantly. “What if I did tell
him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust
into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a
tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a
dog and never even stopped his car.”

There was nothing I could say, except the one un-
utterable fact that it wasn’t true.

“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering
—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw
that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the side-
board, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was
awful—~”

I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that
what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was
all very careless and confused. They were careless
people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and
creatures and then retreated back into their money or
their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept

them together, and let other people clean up the mess
they had made. . . .

I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for
I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.
Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl
necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid
of my provincial squeamishness forever.

Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass
on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the
taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the
entrance gate without stopping for a minute and point-
ing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and
Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and
perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I
didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off
the train.

I spent my Saturday nights in New York because
those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me
so vividly that I could still hear the music and the
laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the
cars going up and down his drive. One night I did
hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his
front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was
some final guest who had been away at the ends of
the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.

On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car
sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge
incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white
steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a
piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and
I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone.
Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out
on the sand.

182 THE GREAT GATSBY

Most of the big shore places were closed now and
there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, mov-
ing glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the
moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt
away until gradually I became aware of the old island
here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a
fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees,
the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had
once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of
all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment
man must have held his breath in the presence of this
continent, compelled into an esthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the
last time in history with something commensurate to
his capacity for wonder.

And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown
world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first
picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock.
He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his
dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly
fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already
behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity be-
yond the city, where the dark fields of the republic
rolled on under the night.

Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic fu-
ture that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us
then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster,
stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morn-
ing——

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back
ceaselessly into the past.
